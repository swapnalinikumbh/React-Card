# First React App

A simple React app (more like a component) which is a **card** with a _counter_ (displayed as a number) and _three buttons_:

- a '**+**' button to increase the counter
- a '**-**' button to decrease the counter
- a '**reset**' button to reset the counter back to 0 (zero).

The **_background-color_** of the card also changes with each click.

#Install dependancy
